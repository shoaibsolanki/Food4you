            3.1. We partner with third-party logistics service providers in
            order to effectuate Product shipping and delivery to you (“Logistics
            Partners”). We shall provide the details of the Logistics Partner
            who will be responsible for processing the shipping and delivery of
            any Product(s) purchased by you on the Website at the time such
            Product is processed and successfully handed over to the Logistics
            Partner by us. The Products are usually dispatched within 2 to 4
            days of receiving the Order on Fastside. In any case, the User will
            be provided with an estimated timeline for the delivery of the
            Product purchased from Fastside. This estimated timeline shall be
            notified to the user on the order confirmation page displayed at the
            time the order is confirmed by us. We will also share details about
            your orders pursuant to their dispatch on the email ID and/or mobile
            number provided by you/ registered with us. You agree and understand
            that though we effectuate Product delivery to the Users through our

            Products on our own without engaging any Logistics Partners or
            third-party service providers. You agree and understand that though
            we endeavor to ship and deliver our Products all across India, we
            may, in our sole discretion, determine a select list of areas which
            are unserviceable for delivery of Products, from time to time. We or
            our Logistics Partners do not provide shipping and delivery services
            in such unserviceable areas and may not process your orders on the
            Website in such cases. In the event an area has been deemed
            unserviceable by us, we shall notify such user at the time of
            placing an order for purchase of Products on the Website. You may
            also verify whether an area is unserviceable for deliveries by us by
            entering the relevant area pin-code on Fastside.

          <p className="mb-4">
            3.2. You agree and acknowledge that to effectuate timely delivery of

            information like your name, shipping address, billing address,
            landmarks, contact details, etc. You shall ensure that all
            information that is submitted by you to us on the Website is true,
            complete, accurate, and sufficient to identify the actual place of
            delivery. You understand that you shall bear absolute liability in
            case of any failure by us in delivering the purchased Products due
            to your failure to provide correct, complete, sufficient, and
            accurate information at the time of placing the order. It is further
            clarified that we shall not be liable in any manner and at any point
            in time due to your failure to provide correct and complete

            a maximum of three (3) attempts to deliver the purchased Product(s)

            delivery of purchased Products. Further, we shall be under no
            obligation to compensate you for any claim that may otherwise arise
            on account of delay in the shipment or delivery or use of the
            purchased Products.

            with the highest regard for ethics and integrity; and who behave in
            a fashion that exudes thorough professionalism, competence, and good
            mannerism. You agree and acknowledge that the actions, inactions of
            delivery individuals are not in our control, and it is not possible
            for us to monitor and observe each delivery executive. Since we are
            merely facilitating the delivery of a Product purchased by you, we
            shall not be liable for any acts or omissions on part of our
            delivery agents, employees, or personnel and/or the Logistics
            Partners or their employees, agents, or personnel including
            deficiency in service, wrong delivery of Product, time taken to
            deliver the Product, Product package tampering, misconduct, etc. For
            the sake of abundant clarity, it is stated that any ill-mannerism,
            impoliteness, discourtesy, or offensiveness shown by our delivery
            executives or the employees, agents, or personnel of the Logistics
            Partners is beyond our control and any issue arising between you and
            our delivery executive or an employee, agent, or personnel of the
            Logistics Partners will have to be resolved by you, independently.
            You agree and acknowledge that you will not hold us responsible or
            require us to settle, mediate or resolve any disputes between you
            and the delivery personnel delivering the Products to you.

          <p className="mb-4">
            3.7. Once you place an order on Fastside, we process such order and
            hand over the purchased Product to our Logistics Partner. The User
            will receive a unique tracking identity number once the purchased
            Product is handed over to the Logistics Partner, which will enable
            the User in tracking the status of delivery of the purchased
            Products. The User may use the tracking identity number on the
            Website or the website and/or the mobile application of the
            Logistics Partner to check the status and location of the purchased
            Product and its estimated time of delivery. Our operations and
            service teams coordinate with the Logistics Partners to ensure that
            the Products are delivered to you at the earliest and make all
            reasonable efforts in ensuring that the Logistics Partners update
            the tracking status of the purchased Products on a real-time basis.
            It is clarified that we engage third-party service providers to
            effectuate deliveries of the Products and hence, we do not guarantee
            the accuracy or correctness of the tracking status and the status
            may be subject to inconsistencies arising out of time-lags in
            updating the information and/or other technical difficulties which
            are not in our control.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            3.8. We reserve the right to charge or collect shipping fees on
            Products from time to time. Shipping charges may vary based on the
            value of the Product, type of Product, area of delivery, payment
            mechanism, etc. In the event we charge a shipping fee for the
            delivery of a purchased Product, such shipping fees will not be
            refunded by us pursuant to any return request raised by you.
            However, we may make exceptions and refund the shipping fees in the
            event a defected, damaged, deficient, or incorrect Product (for
            reasons attributable to, and accepted by us after due verification
            in our sole discretion) has been delivered. You acknowledge and
            accept that the title and risk of all Products ordered by you shall
            pass on to you upon the delivery of the purchased Products to you.
