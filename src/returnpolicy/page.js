            refunds in your bank account (as per the bank account details
            provided by you to us) in case the Product is purchased from a
            third-party seller made available. However, if the sale was
            consummated by Fastside, you will receive your refund in your
            Wallet. We do not make any cash refunds.

            happen by the date advised, you may contact us, and we will gladly
            help you.
